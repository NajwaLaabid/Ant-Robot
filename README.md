# Ant-Robot-using-Ev3-Lego-Mindstorms
This is a class project modeling the foraging behavior of Cataglyphis ants using Ev3 Lego Mindstorms Robot. This repo contains the research paper supporting the model, pictures of the physical built, and the files of code necessary to run the bot.

The following information provides a quick overview on the project: https://www.beloit.edu/news/sources/?story_id=397079

1. Context: 

As mentioned earlier, this project was a class requirement for the course Cognitive Robotics in Beloit College. Simply described, Cognitive Robotics is a hybrid computer science/cognitive science (or philosophy) course. It explores the recent theories in the fields of cognitive science/philosophy of brain or consciousness/ Artificial Intelligence, and aims to concretize them through robot building using Ev3 Mindstorms Robots. 

More about the course here: 

This robot was our final assignment in the course. We were asked to model the biological behavior of an animal (yes, any animal :D).

2. Why ants?

Because they are fascinating. The goal initially was to showcase ants' group intelligence in its foraging activities. Limitations in time and resources made us switch to individual foraging. 

3. Why Cataglyphis ants?

Most ants forage in groups. Cataglyphis ants (desert ants), are some of the few species out there with an individualistic approach to food gathering, due to the harsh environment they live in. 

4. In brief, what does the robot do?

It locates its "food" (an IR bacon), fetches it, and brings it back to its "nest" (initial position). 

5. What do you need to build a similar (or even cooler) robot?

- An Ev3 kit (educational or home edition. Both should work).
- Java environment and lejos plug-in installed (check environment settings file for more info).
- Some creativity and patience :)
