# Ant Robot using Ev3 Lego Mindstorms
This is a class project modeling the foraging behavior of Cataglyphis ants using Ev3 Lego Mindstorms Robot. This repo contains the research paper supporting the model, pictures of the physical built, and the files of code necessary to run the bot.

The following information provides a quick overview of the project: 

## 1. Context:

As mentioned earlier, this project was a class requirement for the course Cognitive Robotics in Beloit College (you can find the course description in the [course catalog](https://www.beloit.edu/cognitivescience/courses/) of the cognitive science department @ Beloit). 

This robot was our final assignment in the course. We were asked to model the biological behavior of an animal (yes, any animal :D) as a synthesis for our work on philosophical theories about the mind and cognition and how they influence artificial intelligence and robotics. 

## 2. Why ants?

Because they are fascinating. The goal initially was to showcase ants' group intelligence in its foraging activities. Limitations in time and resources made us switch to individual foraging. 

## 3. Why Cataglyphis ants?

Most ants forage in groups. Cataglyphis ants (desert ants), are some of the few species out there with an individualistic approach to food gathering, due to the harsh environment they live in. 

## 4. In brief, what does the robot do?

It locates its "food" (an IR bacon), fetches it, and brings it back to its "nest" (initial position). 

## 5. What do you need to build a similar (or even cooler) robot?

- An Ev3 kit (educational or home edition. Both should work).
- Java environment and lejos plug-in installed.
- Some creativity and patience :)
